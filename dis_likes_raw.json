I promise I will make it up to you, as this has taught me more about life than anything I've ever been through. I'm still young and an idiot and I'll probably make a million more mistakes- but I will own up to them in a courageous and honest fashion from this point forward. Because you guys deserve that. You guys are my family and I owe you at least that. I know it will take a while for me to gain your trust back, and I completely am ready for that and deserve that. So until that point, I promise to be entirely transparent, because I love you and can't imagine a life without you. You guys truly saved my life, doing this saved my life. And I don't want to live a life where I can't do this. I don't want to live a life without you- so I will fight for that. I want to get back to doing what I love. Sharing my story in the realest possible way, to the people I love. THANK YOU for holding me accountable and calling me out when I deserved it. Thank you for supporting me at my lowest point, thank you for being the family I never had, and probably don't deserve. I love you.
